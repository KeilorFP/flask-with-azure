# ðŸš€ End-to-End ML Model Deployment (API + Web App)

This project demonstrates the **full pipeline of building, saving, and deploying a machine learning model** using toy data. The model is exposed via both a **REST API** and a **web application**, and deployed to a cloud platform using **free-tier services** (Heroku, AWS, GCP, or Azure).
